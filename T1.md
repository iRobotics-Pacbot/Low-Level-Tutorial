# ESP8266 PlatformIO Tutorial: From Basics to FreeRTOS

## Introduction

Welcome to this hands-on tutorial for getting started with ESP8266 using PlatformIO! We'll cover the basics of setting up your development environment and then dive into a series of challenges to learn about serial communication, GPIO, PWM, and servos. Finally, we'll introduce you to the basics of FreeRTOS.

## Setting Up PlatformIO

1. Install Visual Studio Code (VSCode) from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Open VSCode and go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search for "PlatformIO" and install the PlatformIO IDE extension
4. Restart VSCode after the installation

## Creating Your First Project

1. Click on the PlatformIO icon in the left sidebar
2. Choose "New Project"
3. Name your project "ESP8266_Tutorial"
4. Select "Espressif ESP8266 ESP-12E" as your board
5. Choose "Arduino" as your framework
6. Wait for the project to be created and initialized

## Challenge 1: Hello, Serial!

**Objective**: Print "Hello, ESP8266!" to the serial monitor every second.

1. Open `src/main.cpp`
2. Replace the contents with the following code:

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
}

void loop() {
  Serial.println("Hello, ESP8266!");
  delay(1000);
}
```

3. Build and upload the code to your ESP8266
4. Open the Serial Monitor to see the output

**Challenge**: Modify the code to print the number of seconds since the ESP8266 started.

## Challenge 2: Blinky LED

**Objective**: Make the built-in LED blink every 500ms.

1. Modify `src/main.cpp`:

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>

const int LED_PIN = 2;  // Built-in LED on ESP-12E module

void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);
  delay(500);
}
```

2. Upload and observe the blinking LED

**Challenge**: Create a morse code function that blinks "SOS" (... --- ...) repeatedly.

## Challenge 3: PWM LED Control

**Objective**: Use PWM to gradually fade the LED in and out.

1. Update `src/main.cpp`:

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>

const int LED_PIN = 2;

void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  for (int i = 0; i <= 255; i++) {
    analogWrite(LED_PIN, i);
    delay(10);
  }
  for (int i = 255; i >= 0; i--) {
    analogWrite(LED_PIN, i);
    delay(10);
  }
}
```

2. Upload and observe the fading LED

**Challenge**: Implement a "breathing" effect by using a sine wave for smoother transitions.

## Challenge 4: Servo Control

**Objective**: Control a servo motor using the ESP8266.

1. Connect a servo to your ESP8266 (signal wire to GPIO 4, power to 3.3V, ground to GND)
2. Install the "ESP8266Servo" library from PlatformIO Library Manager
3. Update `src/main.cpp`:

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <ESP8266Servo.h>

Servo myservo;
const int SERVO_PIN = 4;

void setup() {
  myservo.attach(SERVO_PIN);
}

void loop() {
  myservo.write(0);
  delay(1000);
  myservo.write(90);
  delay(1000);
  myservo.write(180);
  delay(1000);
}
```

4. Upload and watch the servo move

**Challenge**: Create a function that moves the servo to a random position every 2 seconds.

## Introduction to FreeRTOS

FreeRTOS is a real-time operating system that allows you to create tasks that run concurrently. Let's create a simple example using FreeRTOS and explore its key concepts.

1. Update `src/main.cpp`:

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>
#include <Ticker.h>

Ticker blinker;
const int LED_PIN = 2;
bool ledState = false;

void blinkLED() {
  ledState = !ledState;
  digitalWrite(LED_PIN, ledState);
}

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
  
  blinker.attach(0.5, blinkLED);  // Blink LED every 500ms
  
  xTaskCreate(
    [](void * parameters) {
      for(;;) {
        Serial.println("Hello from FreeRTOS task!");
        vTaskDelay(1000 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS);
      }
    },
    "PrintTask",
    1000,
    NULL,
    1,
    NULL
  );
}

void loop() {
  // The loop function can be empty when using FreeRTOS
}
```

2. Upload and observe the LED blinking and serial output

This example demonstrates two concurrent operations:
- Blinking the LED using the Ticker library
- Printing a message every second using a FreeRTOS task

### Understanding xTaskCreate

The `xTaskCreate` function is fundamental to FreeRTOS. It's used to create a new task. Let's break down its parameters:

```cpp
BaseType_t xTaskCreate(
    TaskFunction_t pvTaskCode,
    const char * const pcName,
    uint16_t usStackDepth,
    void *pvParameters,
    UBaseType_t uxPriority,
    TaskHandle_t *pxCreatedTask
);
```

In our example:

```cpp
xTaskCreate(
    [](void * parameters) {
        for(;;) {
            Serial.println("Hello from FreeRTOS task!");
            vTaskDelay(1000 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS);
        }
    },
    "PrintTask",
    1000,
    NULL,
    1,
    NULL
);
```

Let's examine each parameter:

1. `TaskFunction_t pvTaskCode`: This is the actual function that will run as a task. We're using a lambda function that prints a message and then delays for 1 second.

2. `const char * const pcName`: This is a name for the task, used for debugging. We've named it "PrintTask".

3. `uint16_t usStackDepth`: This is the stack size in words. We've allocated 1000 words.

4. `void *pvParameters`: These are parameters to pass to the task. We're not using any, so it's NULL.

5. `UBaseType_t uxPriority`: This sets the priority of the task. We've set it to 1, which is a low priority.

6. `TaskHandle_t *pxCreatedTask`: This is a handle to the created task. We're not storing the handle, so it's NULL.

### Basics of the FreeRTOS Scheduler

The FreeRTOS scheduler is responsible for deciding which task should be running at any given time. It uses a priority-based preemptive scheduling algorithm. Here are some key points:

- Each task is given a priority (in our case, we set it to 1).
- The scheduler ensures that the highest priority task that is ready to run gets CPU time.
- Tasks with the same priority are scheduled round-robin (they take turns).
- Lower priority tasks only run when no higher priority tasks are ready.
- `vTaskDelay()` is used to make a task "sleep" for a specified time, allowing other tasks to run.

In our example, we only have one task, so it will run repeatedly, printing the message and then delaying for 1 second.

### Understanding blinker.attach

The `blinker.attach` function is not part of FreeRTOS, but comes from the Ticker library, which is specific to ESP8266. Here's how it's used in our code:

```cpp
Ticker blinker;
blinker.attach(0.5, blinkLED);
```

The `attach` function sets up a function to be called repeatedly at a specified interval. It takes two parameters:

1. `float seconds`: The interval in seconds. In our case, it's 0.5 seconds.
2. `callback_t callback`: The function to be called. In our case, it's `blinkLED`.

This setup will cause the `blinkLED` function to be called every 0.5 seconds, toggling the LED state. This happens independently of the FreeRTOS task we created.

### Conclusion

In this example, our program is doing two things concurrently:
1. Blinking an LED every 0.5 seconds using the Ticker library.
2. Printing a message every second using a FreeRTOS task.

This demonstrates how we can handle multiple operations on the ESP8266, some using FreeRTOS (like our printing task) and others using platform-specific libraries (like the LED blinking with Ticker).

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics of FreeRTOS and task creation, try these challenges:

1. Create a second task that increments a counter and prints its value every 5 seconds.
2. Modify the LED blinking task to use FreeRTOS instead of the Ticker library.
3. Implement a simple state machine using FreeRTOS tasks to control multiple LEDs.

Remember, FreeRTOS is a powerful tool for managing concurrent operations on your ESP8266. As you build more complex projects, you'll find it invaluable for organizing your code and managing multiple simultaneous tasks.
